# FER/UFR Scaling Experiments

See `README_previous.md` for background on the original paper.

This repo extends the prior with some new concepts, like conditional CPPNs which encode multiple images in one network.

How does model scaling affect representations? Is there a way that we can get SGD to learn more UFR representations?
